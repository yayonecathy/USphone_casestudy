# US Smartphone Market Analysis and 2025 Prediction
## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Machine Learning and Data Analysis project on the US Smartphone Market dataset. 
The data was collected by one of the vendors in the United States, which was altered to show similarities with the real data. 
The goal of this project is to 1)Analyze Yearly & Qaurterly Trend - Q1'22~Q4'24 (Volume, Revenue & Average Sales Pricing) and 2) Examine the monthly trend and identify the top 5 significant changes, and 3) Forecast the 2025 US smartphone market in terms of volume, revenue, and average selling price (ASP)

## Project Objectives:

- Provide visualizations and summary statistics, as well as prescriptive recommendations.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, redundant values, and outliers.
- Feature Engineering to include external variables mentioned above.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of variables.
- - Visualization of key insights using Tableau.
Documentation of analysis steps, insights, and recommendations.
